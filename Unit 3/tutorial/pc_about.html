          <h2>Our Company</h2>
          <img src="pc_photo6.png" alt="" />
          <p>We are a company located in Essex, Vermont, dedicated to 
            making delicious chocolate and other treats. For our founder, 
            chocolatier Anne Ambrose, this means using only the finest 
            organic ingredients, incorporating a harmonious blend of rich 
            flavors and smooth textures</p>
            <p>Anne learned her trade as part of a three-year apprenticeship 
               program in Switzerland. Her introduction into the world of 
               confectioneries was a springboard to working with leaders in
               the field. Early in 1993 she brought that expertise back to 
               Vermont and Pandaisia Chocolates was born.</p>

               <h3>Enjoying Chacolates</h3>
               <p>We believe that the best chocolate is fresh chocolate. 
                  Preservatives change the flavor and texture of chocolate. 
                  For the best results, our chocolates should be consumed 
                  within a few days of purchase. Store them in a
                  cool, dark place at a temperature of 60&deg; to 
                  70&deg; such as a refrigerator or wine cellar.</p>

               <h3>Healthy Chacolate</h3>
               <p>Chocolate has a bad reputation because of the poor 
                  quality of mass-produced bars loaded with lots of milk, 
                  sugar, and butter &mdash; which are tasty but not 
                  healthy. We start with organic ingredients, keep the 
                  processed sugars to a minimum and produce dark chocolate 
                  that is 73% cacao. At that level, you can reap the benefits 
                  of a chocolate diet!</p>
